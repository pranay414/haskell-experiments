# Experiments with Haskell
I've recently started exploring functional programming. The goal is to create a repository of Haskell programs which'll serve as examples for others who want to try to understand functional programming paradigm.

## What is my motivation?
I want to learn about functional programming paradigm and see whether I can use **Haskell** in web development.
